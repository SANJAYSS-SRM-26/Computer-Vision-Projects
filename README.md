# Computer-Vision-Project
This repository contains three foundational **computer vision projects** demonstrating key image processing techniques using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
Each project includes both **source code** and **sample input images** for easy testing and experimentation.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🔷 1. Shape Detection
Detects and classifies basic geometric shapes such as circles, triangles, rectangles, and squares in an image.

**Techniques Used:**
- Contour detection  
- Polygon approximation  
- Thresholding and binary masking  

---

### ⚪ 2. Edge Detection
Identifies the boundaries and outlines of objects within an image using various edge detection techniques.

**Techniques Used:**
- Canny edge detection
  
---

### 🟡 3. Harris Corner Detection
Detects corners and feature points within an image using the **Harris Corner Detection algorithm**.

**Techniques Used:**
- Gradient computation  
- Corner response function  
- Thresholding and visualization
